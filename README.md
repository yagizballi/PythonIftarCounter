# Python Iftar Counter
 In this project, Python fetches iftar hours from the https://aladhan.p.rapidapi.com/timingsByCity API using the https://rapidapi.com platform. To use this code, you need to set your RapidApi key and specify your country and city information in the main.py file.
 To use the "requests" library, you need to install it first. You can do this by running the following command:
 ```
 pip install -U requests
 ```
